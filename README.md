**Installing:**
 1. Clone files to your local/shared hosting
 2. Change configurations in `/php/post.php` (6-12 lines)
 3. Now you can start using with index.html

**Testing:**

 There is a file named `telegram.php` in `/php` folder. This file will generate different fake responses with different codes/messages like real telegram servers. But first of all you have to uncomment the test url and comment original telegram url inside file `php/post.php` (96-100 lines).
